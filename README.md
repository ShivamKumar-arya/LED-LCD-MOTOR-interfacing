 
This project demonstrates how to interface multiple output devices‚ÄîLEDs, a 16x2 LCD, and a DC motor‚Äîsimultaneously using an Arduino Uno or ATmega328P microcontroller. The LEDs blink in sequence while the motor runs and the LCD provides real-time status updates.

The objective is to show how to handle parallel peripheral control in embedded systems and can be a helpful experiment for beginners in electronics and Arduino programming.

Use Case: Ideal for learning multitasking on Arduino, understanding pin management, and combining digital I/O with actuators and displays.

It showcases basic multitasking by combining visual output, motor control, and display feedback in one embedded system.

üõ† How It Works:

‚úÖLED:

The LED blinks whenever the DC motor is rotating in any direction.
The LED is turn OFF when the motor is in the OFF state.

‚úÖLCD (16x2 Display):

Displays the motor status:

"Motor ON" when running

"Motor OFF" when stopped

‚úÖShows the direction of rotation:

"Clockwise" when serial monitor input is "1"

"Anticlockwise" when serial monitor input is "2"

"No Direction"when serial monitor input is " any value remaining 1 or 2" and  motor is off.

‚úÖDC Motor:

The motor turns ON for a short time (as per logic/code)

Then automatically stops, with status updated on the LCD

üìã Features 

‚úÖ Controls multiple peripherals simultaneously (LED, LCD, Motor)

‚úÖ Provides real-time feedback using the LCD

‚úÖ Demonstrates basic multitasking without RTOS

‚úÖ Can be extended to real-world applications like:
                                              
-Automation systems

-Robotics control

-DIY home appliances

üß† Future Improvements

- Add **push buttons** to control motor direction manually  
- Replace LED with **RGB LED** for color-coded status  
- Include **sensors** for feedback-based motor control  
- Use **interrupts** or **timers** for advanced multitasking
