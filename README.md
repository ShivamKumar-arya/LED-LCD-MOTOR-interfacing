# LED-LCD-MOTOR-interfacing 
This project demonstrates how to interface multiple output devices—LEDs, a 16x2 LCD, and a DC motor—simultaneously using an Arduino Uno or ATmega328P microcontroller. The LEDs blink in sequence while the motor runs and the LCD provides real-time status updates.

The objective is to show how to handle parallel peripheral control in embedded systems and can be a helpful experiment for beginners in electronics and Arduino programming.

Use Case: Ideal for learning multitasking on Arduino, understanding pin management, and combining digital I/O with actuators and displays.

It showcases basic multitasking by combining visual output, motor control, and display feedback in one embedded system.

🧩 Additional Wiring Details:

LCD (16x2, Parallel Mode)

VSS, K → GND

VDD, A → +5V

RW → GND

V0 → Middle pin of potentiometer (for contrast control)

🧩LED:

Anode → 220Ω Resistor → D8

Cathode → GND

🧩Motor:

Motor +ve → Collector of transistor

Motor -ve → GND


🛠 How It Works:

✅LED:

The LED blinks whenever the DC motor is rotating in any direction.
The LED is turn OFF when the motor is in the OFF state.

✅LCD (16x2 Display):

Displays the motor status:

"Motor ON" when running

"Motor OFF" when stopped

✅Shows the direction of rotation:

"Clockwise" when serial monitor input is "1"

"Anticlockwise" when serial monitor input is "2"

"No Direction"when serial monitor input is " any value remaining 1 or 2" and  motor is off.

✅DC Motor:

The motor turns ON for a short time (as per logic/code)

Then automatically stops, with status updated on the LCD

📋 Features 

✅ Controls multiple peripherals simultaneously (LED, LCD, Motor)

✅ Provides real-time feedback using the LCD

✅ Demonstrates basic multitasking without RTOS

✅ Can be extended to real-world applications like:
                                              
-Automation systems

-Robotics control

-DIY home appliances

🧠 Future Improvements

- Add **push buttons** to control motor direction manually  
- Replace LED with **RGB LED** for color-coded status  
- Include **sensors** for feedback-based motor control  
- Use **interrupts** or **timers** for advanced multitasking
